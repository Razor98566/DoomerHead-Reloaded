# DoomerHead-Reloaded
A mod for the game Starsector that reverts two nerfs

This mod was a request of a good friend of mine who really wants to play the unnerfed Doom and Hammerhead.
It essentially started as a joke but I pledged to eventually do it and now the time has come.

The following things are reversed:
- The Hammerhead got it's old firing arcs and stats, meaning higher Flux and 360 degree Point Defense
- The Doom now moves at normal speed when in Phase aka the Speed reduction when Flux is generated was removed

  Both ships have been implemented as new ship, meaning the old ones are still there and they exist alongside each other.
  I also altered their sprites so they are easily distinguishable.

  The pride of the Albanian space navy lies in these two ships.

  Enjoy :)
